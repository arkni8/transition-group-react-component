# Animating React Component While Mount and Unmount

- This is written in React.
- This is also using animejs. Feel free to replace it with your own animation library or CSSlibrary. 
- Transition element is used from react-transition-group. But it can also be replaced by good ol' CSSTransition component and 
just straight away remove the `useEffect`.
- nodeRef has to be assigned to the children that is getting animated. DO NOT FORGET TO ASSIGN the `nodeRef`.
- Have fun!
